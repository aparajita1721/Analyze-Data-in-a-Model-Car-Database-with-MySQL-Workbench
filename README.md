## Performing exploratory data analysis on the database using SQL queries
### Problem:-
To analyze data in a relational database using SQL queries with the goal of supporting inventory-related business decisions that lead to the closure of a storage facility.
### Questions 

1) Where are items stored and if they were rearranged, could a warehouse be eliminated?
2) How are inventory numbers related to sales figures? Do the inventory counts seem appropriate for each item?
3) Are we storing items that are not moving? Are any items candidates for being dropped from the product line?
4) If we decrease the stocks by 5% for each of the products does it affect the sales?
5) Is price a major factor in popularity of the products?
6) What is profit percentage earned in the products that were sold the most?
7) What is profit percentage earned in the products that were sold the least?

### Method
We used SQL queries on MySQL Workbench to perform exploratory data analysis. To begin with, we with imported the database using the SQL script linked here-     and studied the schema using the EER (Extended Entity-Relationship diagram). Further, we identified the tables and fields that could provide relavent informations to the questions asked above and support our insights.
